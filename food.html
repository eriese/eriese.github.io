  Food for the Gods was written and conceived by Nehprii Ameni in response to the killings of Troy Davis, Trayvon Martin, and Kimani Gray, and as a reaction to the statistic that every 36 hours a young black person in the United States is killed extrajudicially by a police officer, security guard, or self-appointed law enforcer.
